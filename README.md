Producing a test coverage report for iOS and OSX projects requires a mish-mash of tools and steps. Here we've glued them all together into something that (hopefully) just works. 

* Generates a report with minimal steps.
* Outputs to the terminal as well as produces a detailed report in build-server friendly HTML format.
* Includes a coverage checker. This can be used in CI builds to check minimum test coverage - failing the build if coverage falls below the required amount.
* Free for both commercial and open-source projects.

 
# Installing

The script itself can be run remotely, but we'll first need to install dependencies .  .

### With HomeBrew

```sh
brew install groovy
brew install lcov
```

### With MacPorts

```sh
sudo port install groovy
sudo port install lcov
```

*NB:* Xcode 7.x requires lcov 1.12, please ensure that you have this version with `lcov --version`

# Usage

Set your main App target to produce test coverage output (debug mode only).

Set your main App target to instrument program flow (debug mode only). 

![Enable Instrumentation](http://frankencover.it/images/Instrument.png)

### IDE Use

Run tests in your IDE (AppCode or Xcode) and produce a report with: 

```sh
groovy http://frankencover.it/with -source-dir MyProject/Source
```

### Build server or cmd-line use

Create a build script as follows

```sh
# First Run Tests
xcodebuild test -workspace MyProject.xcworkspace/ -scheme 'MyProject' -configuration Debug \
-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 5s,OS=8.1' | xcpretty -c --report junit
#Above we are piping the build output through xcpretty, which is not required, but very nice. 
#(gem install xcpretty)

# Now Produce Test Coverage Report
groovy http://frankencover.it/with -source-dir MyProject/Source -required-coverage 85
#Above we set required coverage to 85%. Build fails if coverage falls below this value. 
```

. . this ensures using an update to date version. 

# Output

#### cmd-line

#### browser

Report file is at `build/reports/coverage/index.html`.

#### Cobertura Format

If you'd like to publish in Cobertura format (commonly supported by build servers) we recommend <a href="https://github.com/eriwen/lcov-to-cobertura-xml">this Python script</a>. 

Place the script somewhere on visible to your build server or whatever needs cobertura format, and then execute as follows: 

```sh
python ~/lcov_cobertura.py build/reports/coverage/data/coverage.info
```

#### Install locally

If you don't want to run the hosted script, it can be installed locally with:

```sh
curl -SSL http://frankencover.it/with > FrankenCover && chmod +x ./FrankenCover
```


# Swift Code Coverage

At the present time Swift Code coverage because the compiler currently ignores instructions to instrument the codebase. Please vote for this OpenRadar issue.
